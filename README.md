# Image Caption Generator

This is a full-stack web application that allows users to upload an image and receive a descriptive caption generated by an AI model. The application provides a user-friendly interface for image uploads, displays processing feedback, and presents the generated caption.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
*   **HTML5**: For structuring the web content.
*   **CSS3**: For styling the user interface.
*   **JavaScript**: For interactive functionality and communication with the backend.

### Backend
*   **Python**: The primary programming language.
*   **Flask**: A micro web framework for building the API.
*   **Flask-CORS**: For handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
*   **Pillow**: Python Imaging Library for image processing.
*   **requests**: For making HTTP requests (though now primarily for `dotenv` setup).
*   **python-dotenv**: For loading environment variables.
*   **Hugging Face Transformers**: For integrating and running the image captioning AI model locally.
*   **PyTorch**: The deep learning framework used by the Transformers model.

## How to Run the Application

Follow these steps to set up and run the Image Caption Generator on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository (if not already done)

If you haven't already, ensure you are in the `caption-gen` directory.

### 2. Set up the Backend

Navigate to the `backend` directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

#### Install Python Dependencies

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the Backend Server

From the `backend` directory, run:
```bash
python app.py
```
The backend server should start and be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 3. Run the Frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
```bash
cd ../frontend
```

#### Open `index.html`

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking the file or by right-clicking and choosing "Open with" your preferred browser.

### 4. Using the Application

Once both the backend server is running and the `index.html` is open in your browser:

1.  Click "Upload Image" and select an image file.
2.  Click "Generate Caption".
3.  The application will display "Generating caption..." and then show the generated text.

If you encounter any issues, ensure both the backend server is running and your browser is refreshed.
